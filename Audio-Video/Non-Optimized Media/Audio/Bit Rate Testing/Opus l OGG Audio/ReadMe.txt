When using FFprobe on the files encoded within the 
"Bit Rate Too Low" folder I had the same Bit Rate
mismatching I though I only had with AAC. 
For some reason the Opus file encoded with 12k didnt show 
this problem and also, this 12k encoded file named 
Ridiculous12k.opus was the smallest file posible while
keeping a good quality.
