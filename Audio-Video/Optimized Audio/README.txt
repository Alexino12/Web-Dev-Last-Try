You´ll notice the AAC format is missing in this folder.
I couldnt find out the codec parameter/configuration for
 AAC as container of the AAC codec (Is weird the codec serves
 as self-container, I don´t know why though). I had to change
 the container from AAC to MP4 in order to use the Firefox
 guide called (The "codecs" parameter in common media types)
 that shows how to determine what was AAC codec parameter 
for the MIME Type in HTML.
